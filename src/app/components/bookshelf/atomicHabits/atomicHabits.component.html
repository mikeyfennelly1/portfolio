                The Power of Habit is a book that delves into the importance of building habits, and the science of doing so. It provides a very interesting and actionable detail of how habits are built and maintained. Like any good book, after you read this you look at life with a bit of a different perspective. In this book the new perspective that I gained was the role that habits play in our life, and that to a certain extent we are our habits. This book gives you the information needed to redefine your own habits, and I guess in turn reinvent yourself - provided you employ the techniques and knowhow provided in the book.

                This is definitely one of my must-read books because the information in it is both applicable and useful to anyone and everyone.
