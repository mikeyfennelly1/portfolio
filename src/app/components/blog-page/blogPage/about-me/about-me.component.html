    <h1 style="font-weight: bold;  margin-bottom: 30px" id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h1>
    <p>I am a 19 year old from Ireland with many interests from sport to reading and technology.</p>
    <p class="mb-5"><span style="opacity: 75%;">I did my </span><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_Certificate_(Ireland)">Leaving Certificate</a> <span style="opacity: 75%;"> last year (the Irish State exams for leaving secondary/high school). I took a gap year this academic year, and have spent the year working, learning and thinking about what I want to do in the future. I have always been interested in technology, and this interest of mine has really blossomed in the past few months, and I have learned many things from web development to </span><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine Learning</a> <span style="opacity: 75%;"> and </span> <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a><span style="opacity: 75%;">.</span></p>

    <h1 style="font-weight: bold;  margin-bottom: 30px;" id="what-got-me-into-technology">What got me into technology?</h1>
    <p><span style="opacity: 75%;">During one of the COVID lockdowns I started to experiment with </span><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> and </span><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.shopify.com/ie/blog/what-is-dropshipping">Drop Shipping</a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> (selling dog beds and neck massagers). </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style="opacity: 75%;">While doing this, I began teaching myself some new skills in coding, </span><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.blender.org/">3D Rendering with Blender</a><span style="opacity: 75%;">, video graphics with the </span><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.adobe.com/home">Adobe Suite</a> <span style="opacity: 75%;">, and any skills I could get my hands on that would help me to build better user experiences on Shopify.</span>

    <h1 style="margin-top: 75px; margin-bottom: 30px; font-weight: bold;">Software Technologies</h1>
    <p class="">
        The following is a list of the software technologies that I have been learning over the last while:
    </p>
    
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <!-- React --> 
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://react.dev/">React: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;">A component based Javascript/Typescript framework to build modern single-page web applications.</span></li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0px; "><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" class="fw" href="">GSAP: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> A Javascript framework (with React hooks) for building animations in the browser. I gravitated towards this framework because it's timeline features are similar to keyframe oriented animation in Adobe products like After Effects and Premiere Pro.</span></li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 30px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; opacity: 100%;" class="fw" href="">Framer Motion: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> Another Javascript framework for building animations. I no longer use this framework and have completely converted to GSAP because GSAP has a more inuitive and flexible development experience.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Tensorflow -->
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> A Python machine learning and artificial intelligence library which is useful for building and training Neural Networks of all kinds.</span></li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; opacity: 100%;" href="https://keras.io/">Keras: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> A Tensorflow library for creating Neural Networks for Deep Learning. Keras makes it even more simple to create Neural Networks by providing a simple API to interface with Tensorflow. It has many out-of-the-box features for creating both simple and complex models, and useful uilities for preprocessing data.</span></li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 30px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; opacity: 100%;" href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> Another AI library, however this library is a Computer Vision specific (a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that aims at making computers able to see). OpenCV makes it easier to create Computer Vision models of all kinds.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <!-- CI/CD -->
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-integration/#:~:text=Continuous%20integration%20is%20a%20DevOps,builds%20and%20tests%20are%20run.">Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):</a> <span style="opacity: 75%;">I have used </span><a style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> <span style="opacity: 75%;">for automating the delivery of some of my projects.</span></li>
        <!-- Docker -->
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; opacity: 100%;" href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>: <span style="opacity: 75%;"> A containerization technology that allows developers to create ( and most importantly to recreate ) lightweight virtualized environments at the operating system level, either locally or remotely. Docker is something I have only experimented with ( and used in indirectly via </span><a style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> ) so far and look forward to learning in more detail.</span></li>
        <!-- Firebase -->
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="">Firebase: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> Firebase is a Google-provided PaaS that has a host of services such as databases and OAuth solutions, that are easily implemented with the Firebase SDK. I used Firebase for the OAuth and login features of CharlemagneDB and found the documentation to be very good too.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h1 style="margin-top: 75px; margin-bottom: 30px; font-weight: bold;">Content Creation Technologies</h1>
    <p class="">
        The following is a list of the content creation technologies that I have used:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; opacity: 100%;" href="https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> This is software for editing images but more specifically raster graphics (pixelated graphics). I used this software to edit images across my content creation projects and web projects such as thumbnails and logos.</span></li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; opacity: 100%;" href="https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/aftereffects.html">Adobe After Effects: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> This software is used for advanced video effects that are not possible on Premiere Pro such as tracking with null objects. After Effects is used for detailed short clips that require a lot of hardware intense rendering, and comes with plugins such as Geolayers 3, that I used for map animations in my videos.</span></li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; opacity: 100%;" href="https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/premiere.html">Adobe Premiere Pro: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> I used this software for long form video editing, and in contrast to After Effects. I would use this to get basic tasks done fast, such as cuts, audio editing and transitions.</span></li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; opacity: 100%;" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> I used Illustrator to create vector graphics such as .svg and .ai format images, which (in contrast to rasterized images) have perfect quality at all scales. Illustrator provides more tools for working with vector shapes than Photoshop such as the shape builder tool.</span></li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" href="">Adobe XD: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;">I started out designing my UX designs in Adobe XD, I designed the CharlemagneDB and created scroll animations and layouts for both mobile and PC versions of the website.</span> </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; opacity: 100%;" href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;">When my computer had to be repaired I decided to migrate to Figma for UX designs and ended up preferring it over XD.</span> </li>
    </ul>
