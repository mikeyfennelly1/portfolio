    <h1 style="font-family: Inter-Bold;" class="display-2 my-5">About Me</h1>
    <h3 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h3>
    <p>I am a 19 year old from Ireland with many interests from sport to reading and technology.</p>
    <p class="mb-5">I did my <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_Certificate_(Ireland)">Leaving Certificate</a> last year (the Irish State exams for leaving secondary/high school). I took a gap year this academic year, and have spent the year working, learning and thinking about what I want to do in the future. I have always been interested in technology, and this interest of mine has really blossomed in the past few months, and I have learned many things from web development to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine Learning</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="what-got-me-into-technology">What got me into technology?</h3>
    <p>During one of the COVID lockdowns I started to experiment with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shopify.com/ie/blog/what-is-dropshipping">Drop Shipping</a> (selling dog beds and neck massagers). 
    </p>
    <p>
        While doing this, I began teaching myself some new skills in coding, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blender.org/">3D Rendering with Blender</a>, video graphics with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.adobe.com/home">Adobe Suite</a>, and any skills I could get my hands on that would help me to build better user experiences on Shopify.

    <h4>Software Technologies</h4>
    <p class="fw-bold">
        The following is a list of the software technologies that I have been learning over the last while:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://react.dev/">React</a>: A component based Javascript/Typescript framework to build modern single-page web applications.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><a target="_blank" class="fw" href="">GSAP</a>: A Javascript framework (with React hooks) for building animations in the browser. I gravitated towards this framework because it's timeline features are similar to keyframe oriented animation in Adobe products like After Effects and Premiere Pro.</li>
            <li><a target="_blank" class="fw" href="">Framer Motion</a>: Another Javascript framework for building animations. I no longer use this framework and have completely converted to GSAP because GSAP has a more inuitive and flexible development experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a>: A Python machine learning and artificial intelligence library which is useful for building and training Neural Networks of all kinds</li>
        <ul>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a>: A Tensorflow library for creating Neural Networks for Deep Learning. Keras makes it even more simple to create Neural Networks. It has many out-of-the-box features for creating both simple and complex models, and useful uilities for preprocessing data.</li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>: Another AI library, however this library is a Computer Vision specific (a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that aims at making computers able to see). OpenCV makes it easier to create Computer Vision models of all kinds.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): I have used <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> for automating the delivery of some of my projects.</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>: A containerization technology that allows developers to create ( and most importantly to recreate ) lightweight virtualized environments at the operating system level, either locally or remotely. Docker is something I have only experimented with ( and used in indirectly via <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> ) so far and look forward to learning in more detail.</li>

    </ul>
