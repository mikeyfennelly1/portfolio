    <p>I am a 19 year old from Ireland with many interests from sport to reading and technology.</p>
    <p class="mb-5"><span style="opacity: 75%;">I did my </span><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_Certificate_(Ireland)">Leaving Certificate</a> <span style="opacity: 75%;"> last year (the Irish State exams for leaving secondary/high school). I took a gap year this academic year, and have spent the year working, learning and thinking about what I want to do in the future. I have always been interested in technology, and this interest of mine has really blossomed in the past few months, and I have learned many things from web development to </span><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine Learning</a> <span style="opacity: 75%;"> and </span> <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a><span style="opacity: 75%;">.</span></p>

    <h1 style="font-weight: bold;  margin-bottom: 30px;" id="what-got-me-into-technology">What got me into technology?</h1>
    <p><span style="opacity: 75%;">During one of the COVID lockdowns I started to experiment with </span><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> and </span><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.shopify.com/ie/blog/what-is-dropshipping">Drop Shipping</a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> (selling dog beds and neck massagers). </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style="opacity: 75%;">While doing this, I began teaching myself some new skills in coding, </span><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.blender.org/">3D Rendering with Blender</a><span style="opacity: 75%;">, video graphics with the </span><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.adobe.com/home">Adobe Suite</a> <span style="opacity: 75%;">, and any skills I could get my hands on that would help me to build better user experiences on Shopify.</span>

    <h1 style="margin-top: 75px; margin-bottom: 30px; font-weight: bold;">Software Technologies</h1>
    <p class="">
        The following is a list of the software technologies that I have been learning over the last while:
    </p>
    
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <!-- React --> 
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://react.dev/">React: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;">A component based Javascript/Typescript framework to build modern single-page web applications.</span></li>

Keras makes it even more simple to create Neural Networks by providing a simple API to interface with Tensorflow. It has many out-of-the-box features for creating both simple and complex models, and useful uilities for preprocessing data.</span></li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 30px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; opacity: 100%;" href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> Another AI library, however this library is a Computer Vision specific (a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that aims at making computers able to see). OpenCV makes it easier to create Computer Vision models of all kinds.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <!-- CI/CD -->
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-integration/#:~:text=Continuous%20integration%20is%20a%20DevOps,builds%20and%20tests%20are%20run.">Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):</a> <span style="opacity: 75%;"> I have used </span><a style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions </a> <span style="opacity: 75%;">for automating the delivery of some of my projects.</span></li>

I used Firebase for the OAuth and login features of CharlemagneDB and found the documentation to be very good too.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h1 style="margin-top: 75px; margin-bottom: 30px; font-weight: bold;" id="how-i-got-into-content-creation">Content Creation Technologies</h1>
    <p class="">
        The following is a list of the content creation technologies that I have used:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; opacity: 100%;" href="https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> This is software for editing images but more specifically raster graphics (pixelated graphics). I used this software to edit images across my content creation projects and web projects such as thumbnails and logos.</span></li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; opacity: 100%;" href="https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/aftereffects.html">Adobe After Effects: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> This software is used for advanced video effects that are not possible on Premiere Pro such as tracking with null objects. After Effects is used for detailed short clips that require a lot of hardware intense rendering, and comes with plugins such as Geolayers 3, that I used for map animations in my videos.</span></li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; opacity: 100%;" href="https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/premiere.html">Adobe Premiere Pro: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> I used this software for long form video editing, and in contrast to After Effects. I would use this to get basic tasks done fast, such as cuts, audio editing and transitions.</span></li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; opacity: 100%;" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;"> I used Illustrator to create vector graphics such as .svg and .ai format images, which (in contrast to rasterized images) have perfect quality at all scales. Illustrator provides more tools for working with vector shapes than Photoshop such as the shape builder tool.</span></li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" href="https://www.adobe.com/apps/all/desktop/pdp/xd">Adobe XD: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;">I started out designing my UX designs in Adobe XD, I designed the CharlemagneDB and created scroll animations and layouts for both mobile and PC versions of the website.</span> </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; opacity: 100%;" href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma: </a><span style="opacity: 75%;">When my computer had to be repaired I decided to migrate to Figma for UX designs and ended up preferring it over XD.</span> </li>
    </ul>

            <h3 class="mb-0">What got me interested in video editing: </h3>
            <br>
        <h4 class="lh-base">
            <span class="opacity-50">During 2020 while schools were closed in Ireland, I began trying my hand at some new things. One of those things was making small</span> ecommerce websites<span class="opacity-50"> on Shopify. I began getting into ecommerce and all of the creative processes that are required to have a successful ecommerce brand. I needed to drive traffic to my website, and also needed my website to look as good as possible so that people would hopefully buy my product. I became frustrated however with the </span>inflexible design capabitilites of Shopify<span class="opacity-50">, so I began to look into how I could make my webstites and advertising content better. I read books about copywriting for sales so that I could convert more customers from what they read on my website and Facebook Ads. I also began getting into how I could </span>make the visuals of the brand better. <span class="opacity-50">This meant making a  better website and better video advertisement content. This lead me to the topics of</span>  web development<span class="opacity-50">,</span> photorealistic 3d product rendering <span class="opacity-50">and</span>  video and photo editing. 
            <br>
            These skills demonstrate my focus on the development of a brand and a product's image.

            <h3 class="me-5">The start of the channel: </h3>
            <br>
            <span class="opacity-50">In the summer of 2022 I began a YouTube channel called 'Sport Cartel', so that I could get more hands on experience of</span> content creation <span class="opacity-50">and</span> building a brand. <span class="opacity-50">Making a YouTube channel was the perfect exercise in learning all of these skills, as it taught me not only the Adobe Suite, but through the</span> invaluable mistakes I made <span class="opacity-50">has helped me learn a lot about </span>converting viewer<span class="opacity-50">,</span> viewer retention <span class="opacity-50">and what it takes to </span>scale a brand on the front-end. My most valuable lesson<span class="opacity-50"> from making this channel was </span>the value of a team in taking on a big project.
