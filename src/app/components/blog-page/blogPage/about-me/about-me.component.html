    <h1 style="font-family: ivymode; margin-bottom: 30px" id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h1>
    <p>I am a 19 year old from Ireland with many interests from sport to reading and technology.</p>
    <p class="mb-5">I did my <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_Certificate_(Ireland)">Leaving Certificate</a>  last year (the Irish State exams for leaving secondary/high school). I took a gap year this academic year, and have spent the year working, learning and thinking about what I want to do in the future. I have always been interested in technology, and this interest of mine has really blossomed in the past few months, and I have learned many things from web development to <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine Learning</a>  and  <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a>.</p>

    <h1 style="font-family: ivymode;  margin-bottom: 30px;" id="what-got-me-into-technology">What got me into technology?</h1>
    <p>During one of the COVID lockdowns I started to experiment with <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a> and <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.shopify.com/ie/blog/what-is-dropshipping">Drop Shipping</a> (selling dog beds and neck massagers). 
    </p>
    <p>
        While doing this, I began teaching myself some new skills in coding, <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.blender.org/">3D Rendering with Blender</a>, video graphics with the <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.adobe.com/home">Adobe Suite</a> , and any skills I could get my hands on that would help me to build better user experiences on Shopify.

    <h1 style="margin-top: 75px; margin-bottom: 30px; font-family: ivymode;" id="how-i-got-into-content-creation">Content Creation Technologies</h1>
    <p class="">
        The following is a list of the content creation technologies that I have used:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; opacity: 100%;" href="https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop: </a> This is software for editing images but more specifically raster graphics (pixelated graphics).

Illustrator provides more tools for working with vector shapes than Photoshop such as the shape builder tool.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><a style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" href="https://www.adobe.com/apps/all/desktop/pdp/xd">Adobe XD: </a>I started out designing my UX designs in Adobe XD, I designed the CharlemagneDB and created scroll animations and layouts for both mobile and PC versions of the website. </li>

        <h1 style="font-family: 'ivymode';">How I Got Into Content Creation</h1>
        <div class="mt-5">  
        <h4 class="lh-base">
            >During 2020 while schools were closed in Ireland, I began trying my hand at some new things. One of those things was making small ecommerce websites> on Shopify. I began getting into ecommerce and all of the creative processes that are required to have a successful ecommerce brand. I needed to drive traffic to my website, and also needed my website to look as good as possible so that people would hopefully buy my product. I became frustrated however with the inflexible design capabilities of Shopify>, so I began to look into how I could make my websites and advertising content better. I read books about copywriting for sales so that I could convert more customers from what they read on my website and Facebook Ads. I also began getting into how I could make the visuals of the brand better. >This meant making a  better website and better video advertisement content. This led me to the topics of  web development>, photorealistic 3d product rendering >and  video and photo editing. 
            <br>
            These skills demonstrate my focus on the development of a brand and a product's image.
            <br>
            <br>
            >In the summer of 2022 I began a YouTube channel called 'Sport Cartel', so that I could get more hands-on experience of content creation >and building a brand. >Making a YouTube channel was the perfect exercise in learning all of these skills, as it taught me not only the Adobe Suite, but through the invaluable mistakes I made >has helped me learn a lot about converting viewer>, viewer retention >and what it takes to scale a brand on the front-end. My most valuable lesson> from making this channel was the value of a team in taking on a big project.
