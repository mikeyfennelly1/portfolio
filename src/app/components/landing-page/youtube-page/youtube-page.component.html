        <h4 class="me- lh-base">
            <span class="opacity-50">During 2020 while schools were closed in Ireland, I began trying my hand at some new things. One of those things was making small</span> ecommerce websites<span class="opacity-50"> on Shopify. I began getting into ecommerce and all of the creative processes that are required to have a successful ecommerce brand. I needed to drive traffic to my website, and also needed my website to look as good as possible so that people would hopefully buy my product. I became frustrated however with the </span>inflexible design capabitilites of Shopify<span class="opacity-50">, so I began to look into how I could make my webstites and advertising content better. I read books about copywriting for sales so that I could convert more customers from what they read on my website and Facebook Ads. I also began getting into how I could </span>make the visuals of the brand better. <span class="opacity-50">This meant making a  better website and better video advertisement content. This lead me to the topics of</span>  web development<span class="opacity-50">,</span> photorealistic 3d product rendering <span class="opacity-50">and</span>  video and photo editing. 
            <br>
            These skills demonstrate my focus on the development of a brand and a product's image.

            <h3 class="me-5">The start of the channel: </h3>
            <br>
            <span class="opacity-50">In the summer of 2022 I began a YouTube channel called 'Sport Cartel', so that I could get more hands on experience of</span> content creation <span class="opacity-50">and</span> building a brand. <span class="opacity-50">Making a YouTube channel was the perfect exercise in learning all of these skills, as it taught me not only the Adobe Suite, but through the</span> invaluable mistakes I made <span class="opacity-50">has helped me learn a lot about </span>converting viewer<span class="opacity-50">,</span> viewer retention <span class="opacity-50">and what it takes to </span>scale a brand on the front-end. My most valuable lesson<span class="opacity-50"> from making this channel was </span>the value of a team in taking on a big project.
